# referral system
One Bank software was built with aim to earn by referal concept.
The concept was that the ADMIN had a software over the server and the user 1 create their account on the website by paying minimum amount of hundred 100 500-1000 after the payment the account gets activated and then unique code is generated to refer to others once the user 1 refer that code/link to get new account created by user 2. Once user 2 create an account by following referal link. User 1 get credit of the amount paid by user 2.
<br>
Lets for example:
<br>
a. User1 Chose plan of : 500$
<br>
b. USer1 refer its code to user2
<br>
c. user2 activated account by paying same plan of 500$
<br>
d. User1 refer same code/link to 10 users
<br>
e. 10 users activated account by same plan of 500$
<br>
f. ADMIN has 5500$
<br>
g. 5000$ is credited to user1
<br>
h. ADMIN receive benefit of 500$
<br>
i. Similarly all users refer link and earn.
